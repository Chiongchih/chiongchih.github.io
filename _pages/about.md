I am an environmental bioinformatician developing **wastewater-based surveillance and intervention frameworks** for public health. My work integrates **metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, culture-enabled genomics, and deep learning** as equally important investigation approaches to characterize pathogens and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) across the human–environment interface.

My research program focuses on two linked questions: (1) how AMR and pathogen risks are **introduced across borders** (e.g., through travel-associated wastewater signals), and (2) how these risks are **maintained or amplified locally** by ecological and infrastructural factors. Beyond detection, I aim to produce **actionable outputs**: risk stratification models, early-warning indicators, interpretable attribution signals, and surveillance designs that can be implemented in water systems and public health workflows.

I care about reproducible, scalable analytics and transparent communication. I enjoy interdisciplinary teamwork, mentoring trainees, and collaborating with engineers and public health stakeholders to turn high-dimensional multi-omics data into decisions and interventions.

Research focus
======
- Environmental bioinformatics for wastewater-based public health decision-making (One Health)
- Quantifying **cross-border importation** vs **local amplification** of AMR and pathogens
- Deep learning + genomics for prediction, attribution, and risk prioritization
- Translating surveillance into **intervention-ready strategies** (monitoring design, decision thresholds, operational guidance)
