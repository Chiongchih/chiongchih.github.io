I am an environmental bioinformatician working with water engineers to investigate the dissemination of pathogens and antimicrobial resistome from the view of One-Health. I'm interested in the broader application of high-throughput sequencing analyses with the multi-omics approach for the water industry and public health. I want to help water and environmental professionals and public health works navigate these new tools for water treatment and reuse.

I value teamwork, communication and the research community. I love collaborating, consulting with mentoring, and teaching. 

I started research in 2016. I'm a former structural-biologist wannabe and a current bioinformatician now. Interestingly, I worked on the same topic: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) for both of my time as being structural-biologist and environmental bioinformatician.
