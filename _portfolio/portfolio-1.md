In 2022, I had the opportunity to present my research at the Computational Biology Research Center (CBRC) conference. It was an enriching experience to share my findings on antimicrobial resistance dynamics and receive feedback from esteemed colleagues. One of the highlights was meeting Prof. Jill Banfield, a renowned scientist in the field of metagenomics and environmental genomics.
