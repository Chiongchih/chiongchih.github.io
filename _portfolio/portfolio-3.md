In 2023, I had the opportunity to present my research at the ASM Microbe 2023 conference in Houston Texas with my Ph.D. Supervisor Prof. Pei-Ying Hong and colleague Mr. Yevhen Myshkevych It was an enriching experience to share my findings on antimicrobial resistance dynamics and receive feedback from esteemed colleagues from all round the world.
